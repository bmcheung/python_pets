                <p>At Pet Lover, we want to create a community for everyone to be able to search and post for their lost beloved pet.
                 We want to help these beloved pets reunite with their families! If your pet has ventured too far from home, there are many steps
                you can take to locate your furry friend like posting to our Lost and Found Pets community. If you have found a lost pet,
                its owner may have posted information here as well. Pet Lover is here to help put your cherished
                creature back in your arms by spreading the word. It's so important not to lose hope your pet will find its way home again! </p>
                <h3>Adoption</h3>
                <p>Pet adoption is quickly becoming the preferred way to find a new dog, puppy, cat or kitten. Best of all, there are so many benefits when you adopt a dog or adopt a cat
                  over buying. For instance, pet adoption will almost always be more affordable than buying a puppy for sale from a breeder or finding
                  a kitten for sale from a litter. There are more benefits as well. Since pets in rescues and shelters usually come from a home where
                  the owners ran out of money, got divorced, or had to move, it's common to find that the dogs and cats on our website are already
                  housetrained, good with kids, or do well with other pets. People are finding out that buying a puppy for sale from a breeder isn't
                  all it's cracked up to be and the stress of training a puppy is too much these days. Best of all, rescues care for their animals,
                  and the dogs and cats don't leave the organization without having their shots and being taken to the vet. That means less stress,
                  and more savings! So what are you waiting for? Go find that perfect pet!</p>
